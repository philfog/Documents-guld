## Overview

Guld mail is a service which integrates PGP signed emails with the guld filesystem. This allow backup and alternative delivery mechanisms to traditional email. More importantly, it allows a light, email-based interface for guld. Using guld mail, users can make transactions, sign documents, and control any of their files.

## Nodes
Full guld nodes will synchronize emails to the blocktree and check for any events or commands in each message.
## _Maildir_

*Maildir is the chosen format for guld mail, because it stores emails individually in a flexible directory structure. The small files are more efficient for version control. Individual files and flexible directories are both useful for access control.*


OfflineIMAP


## _Mustache_


Mustache is the chosen template language for guld mail, because it is supported by every language guld is likely to be ported to.
